# forest-cover-type-analysis
This project analyzes forest cover types using clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) and classification (Decision Tree, Random Forest) algorithms. It evaluates performance using metrics like Silhouette Coefficient, Balanced Accuracy, and ROC AUC. The repository includes code, results, and detailed analysis for both tasks.
